 The project focuses on leveraging the Safaricom API's functionalities to perform various tasks such as mobile money transactions, airtime top-ups, and accessing customer information.

Using Node.js as the server-side runtime environment, the project establishes a secure connection with the Safaricom API, allowing for seamless communication between the application and Safaricom's services. Node.js provides an efficient and scalable platform for handling asynchronous operations and processing API requests.

MySQL is employed as the project's database management system, allowing for the storage and retrieval of relevant data associated with Safaricom API operations. This includes transaction records, customer details, and other relevant information required for tracking and auditing purposes.

The project utilizes the Safaricom API's documentation and SDKs to interact with specific endpoints and methods. This enables functionalities such as initiating payments, querying transaction status, retrieving customer details, and performing other authorized operations within the Safaricom ecosystem.

To ensure security and confidentiality, the project incorporates authentication mechanisms provided by the Safaricom API, such as OAuth 2.0. This ensures that only authorized users can access and utilize the API functionalities, preventing unauthorized usage and potential security breaches
